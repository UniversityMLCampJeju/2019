*If you have interests in machine learning or deep learning, you should want to have a chance to implement non-trivial and decent applications for learning it deeply. Here is a good news. We invite you to join the 21-day long The 2nd University Machine Learning Camp in Jeju 2019(UMLC2019), where you can do what you want, and have a fun and unforgettable memory with your friends from all over the world.*

*For the period, we will design, implement, and train a deep learning model for a specific application using TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc. from start-to-finish with your mentor. We might have access to some mentors/experts to help you to implement your idea. We hope you get the benefit of this wonderful opportunity in Jeju, the most beautiful island in Korea.*

*All of you guys selected as attendees(mentors and mentees) **will be provided with rooms and meals during the camp** at Jeju National University. Round-trip airfare to Jeju Island (South Korea) will be covered fully for the mentors, and each mentee will be supported up to 500USD for flights. In addition to these benefits, participants will get valuable and practical experiences in the field of machine learning/deep learning. We look forward to your application!*
